<li>Keep track of changes to the grid values using a data structure holding new objects called move.cpp. Add an undo button.</li>
<li>Win solution. Proper checking of all sum cells to see if they are correct. Not comparing to boardSolution!</li>
<li>Once win solution occurs; let the user 'replay' the way the solution was found.</li>
<li>Task 6 - save moves to text file.</li>
<li>Fix load game function.</li>

<h1>GRAPHICAL:</h1>
1. Sums need to be displayed in a better way on the board. Currently the top number is for the horizontal sum and the bottom one is for vertical sums.
    - maybe put a 2x2 table in each sumCell
 

<h1>OPTIONAL:</h1>
1. Highlight cells that have only one possible value - maybe change background color to yellow
2. Have an option to remove non-possible selections in every cell
