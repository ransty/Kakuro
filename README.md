<h1>GRAPHICAL:</h1>
1. Sums need to be displayed in a better way on the board. Currently the top number is for the horizontal sum and the bottom one is for vertical sums.
    - maybe put a 2x2 table in each sumCell
2. Resize Main Window appropriately so that everything fits in.
 

<h1>OPTIONAL:</h1>
1. Highlight cells that have only one possible value - maybe change background color to yellow
2. Have an option to remove non-possible selections in every cell
