<h1>TODO:</h1>
<ol>
<li><strike>Save and load files using both vectors.</strike> Done</li>
<li><strike>Only show possible choices</strike> - making sure to adhere to both parts 3 and 4 of the minimal program list.</li>
<li><strike>While checking for possible choices, horizontal checking is overridding vertical checking.</strike></li>
<li><strike>Keep track of changes to the grid values using a data structure holding new objects called move.cpp. Store them in the vector when the user makes a change.</strike></li> 
<li><strike>Add an undo button allowing the user to undo</strike></li>
<li><strike>Redo move<strike></li>
<li><strike>Win solution. Proper checking of all sum cells to see if they are correct. Not comparing to boardSolution!</strike> Done</li>
<li><strike>Once win solution occurs; let the user 'replay' the way the solution was found.</strike></li>
<li><strike>Task 6 - save moves to text file.</strike></li>
<li><strike>Fix load game function.</strike></li>
<li><strike>Add redo move to save file</strike></li> Complete
<li><strike>Add random number generation to board layouts.</strike> - I don't think we should do this. going to be super hard</li>
<li><strike>Add another grid to the option of grids. Make it a large one (20x20?)</strike></li>
<li><strike>Test that everything still works with such a large board. Try load/save/undo/redo/show solution</strike></li>
<li>Prepare a range of different save files for each board size. Saves that are empty, saves that are almost complete, saves that are complete.</li>
<li><strike>Test overwriting of files. There was a mention about this not working. Fix if need be.</strike></li>
<li>Try and break the program. Fix bugs that are found.</li>

</ol>

<h1>GRAPHICAL:</h1>
1. Sums need to be displayed in a better way on the board. Currently the top number is for the horizontal sum and the bottom one is for vertical sums.
    - maybe put a 2x2 table in each sumCell
2. <strike>Resize Main Window appropriately so that everything fits in.</strike>
3. Fix the problem of displaying 1-9 on a windows PC
 

<h1>OPTIONAL:</h1>
1. <strike>Highlight cells that have only one possible value - maybe change background color to yellow</strike>
2. <strike>Have an option to remove non-possible selections in every cell</strike>
